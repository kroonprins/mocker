* allow latency / throttling simulation
* make it possible to make response in a rule conditional (=> avoid having to put the condition in several fields (e.g. statusCode and body are different depending some condition))
* file download/upload mocking?
* investigate pouchdb as alternative to nedb (because last commit for nedb more than 2 years ago). Related to it: investigate if none of the bigger odm frameworks (e.g. mongoose / waterline) support an embedded db.
* make path and method in request of a rule arrays?
* travis + publish to npm
* serializr also has callback functions => check if promisify
* maybe add watch on yaml files to refresh project memory model when file system changes
* make clustering of mock server possible
* some pretty horrifying object cloning going on => investigate immutable structures (at first sight not straightforward with classes)
* check out chai-as-promised (mainly to see if we can't improve the tests where we check on an expected exception to be thrown for async function (see https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/415))
* jsdoc
* openapi (swagger-jsdoc?)
* fix naming inconsistency . or - (e.g. learing-mode.model vs project-model)
* add ui linting/testing also to git commit hook
