* model validator (maybe https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-validator ?)
* allow latency / throttling simulation
* make it possible to make response in a rule conditional (=> avoid having to put the condition in several fields (e.g. statusCode and body are different depending some condition))
* add linting
* file download/upload mocking?
* investigate pouchdb as alternative to nedb (because last commit for nedb more than 2 years ago). Related to it: investigate if none of the bigger odm frameworks (e.g. mongoose / waterline) support an embedded db.
* make path and method in request of a rule arrays?
* travis + publish to npm
* make it possible to bind all servers to an ip instead of localhost
* review how services are now made singletons => there should be a better pattern
* serializr also has callback functions => check if promisify
